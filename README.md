## Road Map
Note that this is still a very early version some important features that are missing and will be added as time goes by are:
- Optimized layout for larger screens, especially landscape presentation
- Option to remove time selector.
- Option to remove date selector.
- Option to present in inline mode.
- Option to set return format, right now it follows the standard for [input type datetime-local](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.datetime-local.html).
- Better localization, for now it takes language from browser but f.e. weeks always starts on a Sunday.
- And all the other options and methods that you can expect from a date-picker.
